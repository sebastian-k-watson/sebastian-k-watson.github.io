A hybrid liquidity model in DeFi refers to a system that combines both centralized and decentralized liquidity sources. In a hybrid liquidity model, centralized liquidity providers (such as traditional exchanges or market makers) can stake their assets and earn a portion of the trading fees generated on the platform, while decentralized liquidity providers (such as individual users or autonomous market making algorithms) can provide liquidity through automated market making, earning a portion of the spread.

The hybrid approach offers the benefits of both centralized and decentralized systems, allowing for the scalability and speed of centralized solutions while also providing the security and decentralization of decentralized solutions. By combining both sources of liquidity, hybrid models aim to achieve better price stability and minimize the risk of market manipulation.

In the context of DeFi, hybrid liquidity models are often used in stablecoin trading platforms, lending platforms, and other decentralized financial applications where reliable and stable liquidity is crucial for ensuring the smooth functioning of the platform.
