As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, the top 3 DeFi services in the market are:

Uniswap - A decentralized exchange that allows for automated trading of ERC-20 tokens and operates as a liquidity pool where users can provide liquidity and earn trading fees.

Aave - A decentralized lending platform that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. Aave offers flexible and customizable lending options, including flash loans and fixed-term deposits.

MakerDAO - A decentralized platform that allows users to collateralize cryptocurrencies to generate stablecoins that are pegged to the value of the US dollar. MakerDAO's Dai stablecoin is widely used in DeFi as a stable store of value.

It's important to note that the DeFi landscape is rapidly evolving, and new projects and protocols are emerging all the time, so this list may become outdated quickly.
